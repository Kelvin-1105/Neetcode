# 4. Generate Parentheses

### Time and Space Complexity
---
| Data Structure | Time - O(n) | Space - O(n) | 
|--- |--- |--- | 
| Stack | n | 1 |

### Key Takeaways
---
| Method | Description | Example | 
|--- |--- |--- | 
| Recursion | Determine basecase, how to proceed recursively (conditions, etc.) | `if open == closed == n:` <br/> `if open < n` <br/> `if closed < open` | 

 
### Hints
---
- Recursion
- Imagine a tree
- Count the num of parenthesis, open and closed
